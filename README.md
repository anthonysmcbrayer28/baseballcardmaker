the first future Big Leaguer
this app was made when i first got started developing apps it shows how far my skil has progressed Future Big leaguer is a much more polished app. Future Big Leaguer fixes all the problems in baseballcardmaker like the buttons being different sizes and everting being in one vertical row and makes for a better user experience
